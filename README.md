Drip Investor dApp - Polygon Buidl Hackathon Summer 2022

Drip Investor is a dapp that allows permissionless Dollar-Cost-Averaging of tokenized assets. Users can deposit stablecoins, which earn passive lending yield. During regular intervals, stablecoin tokens are withdrawn and swapped using decentralized exchanges to convert into investment tokens of choice. Drip Investor is built via integrations with Aave, Uniswap, and Chainlink Keepers.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
